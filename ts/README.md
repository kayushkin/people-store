# @kayushkin/people-store-types

TypeScript types for people-store's wire format, generated from the Go types in
the root package with [tygo](https://github.com/gzuidhof/tygo). The Go package
is the source of truth; do not edit `model.ts` by hand. Regenerate with
`./generate-ts.sh` at the repo root; `tygo.yaml` names the files it leaves out.

Source-only for now: install with `file:../people-store/ts`.
